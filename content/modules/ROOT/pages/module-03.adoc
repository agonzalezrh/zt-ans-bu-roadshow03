== Scenario 03: Operational Efficiency (Continued)

=== Introduction

Moving beyond technical automation, you'll now explore how Ansible Automation Platform can orchestrate between systems and tools, acting as organizational "glue" that connects different processes and teams. This advanced scenario demonstrates how to integrate vulnerability and compliance management at scale using Red Hat Insights.

Vulnerability and compliance management can be tedious, especially at enterprise scale. However, by integrating Ansible Automation Platform with Red Hat Insights, you can automate these critical security processes while providing real organizational value through reduced mean time to resolution and proactive threat mitigation.

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Red Hat Insights Integration and Remediation

==== Step 1: Configure Insights Credentials

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Infrastructure* → *Credentials*
. Locate the pre-configured Insights credential
. Update the credential with your Red Hat account or Developer account details

.Insights Credential Configuration

==== Step 2: Synchronize Insights Project

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Projects*
. Locate the *Insights* project
. Click *Sync* to synchronize with Red Hat Insights

This will clear any failed status and establish the connection to Red Hat Insights services.

==== Step 3: Register System with Insights

Your RHEL team has provided a template to configure subscription and register the Insights client:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Insights for RHEL* template
. When prompted, provide your Red Hat Subscription/Developer account details

.Insights Login Prompt
image::/insight-login.png[Insights Login Interface]

This template will:
- Register the system with Red Hat subscription services
- Install and configure the Insights client
- Perform the initial system scan
- Upload system data to https://console.redhat.com

==== Step 4: Access Red Hat Insights Console

. Once the job completes, navigate to the `console.redhat.com` tab
. Login with your Red Hat account
. Select the *Insights for RHEL* panel

Red Hat Insights provides comprehensive vulnerability and compliance management, along with many other beneficial services for enterprise infrastructure.

==== Step 5: Review Security Advisories

. Navigate to *Content* → *Advisories*
. Review the list of CVEs identified for your registered node

.Security Advisories Dashboard
image::/advisories.png[Security Advisories List]

Each advisory represents a potential security vulnerability that requires attention and possible remediation.

==== Step 6: Create Remediation Playbook

. Select a CVE advisory (e.g., *RHSA-2024:10274*)
. Click *Remediate*

.Advisory Selection

===== Remediation Configuration:

. Name the remediation playbook: `cve-rhsa-2024-10274`
. Click *Next*
. Ensure your node01 is selected in the system review

.System Review Interface

. Submit the Remediation Review

==== Step 7: Deploy Remediation via Ansible

. Navigate back to the `aap` tab
. Go to *Automation Execution* → *Projects*
. Synchronize your Insights project to pull the new remediation playbook

===== Create Remediation Template:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Create a new template with the following details:

**Template Configuration:**
* *Name:* `CVE-2024-1074`
* *Description:* `Remediation of CVE-2024-1074`
* *Organization:* `Default`
* *Project:* `Insights`
* *Inventory:* `Video Platform Inventory`
* *Playbook:* `cve-rhsa-2024-10274-******` (use the generated playbook name)
* *Execution Environment:* `RHEL EE`
* *Credentials:* `Application Nodes`

. Save and launch the template

==== Step 8: Verify Remediation Completion

After the job completes successfully and the node reboots:

. Navigate to the `console.redhat.com` tab
. Select *Automation Toolkit* → *Remediations*
. Verify your remediation shows as completed

=== Exercise 2: API-Driven Security Intelligence

==== Understanding Insights API Integration

Red Hat Insights provides an extensive API that enables you to gather data, build remediation playbooks, and create self-healing infrastructure using Event-Driven Ansible source plugins. You'll use this API to gather comprehensive security data for your security teams.

==== Step 1: Select Target Advisory

. From the `console.redhat.com` tab, navigate to *Content* → *Advisories*
. Choose an Advisory ID (e.g., *RHSA-2024:9474*)

Make note of the specific advisory ID for the next step.

==== Step 2: Execute CVE Data Collection

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *CVE Advisory* template
. When prompted, provide:
  - Your Red Hat subscription/Developer account credentials
  - The Advisory ID you selected

.CVE Advisory Data Collection

This automation will connect to Insights via API and gather comprehensive data about the CVE for your security team, then automatically send this information to your ITSM system.

==== Step 3: Review Security Intelligence in ServiceNow

. Note the incident number from the completed job
. Navigate to the `servicenow` tab
. Login with the ServiceNow credentials:

===== Access Incident Data:

. Click *All* → *Incidents*
. Select the ticket titled *Advisory CVE Type*
. Review the comprehensive CVE data gathered via API from Red Hat Insights
